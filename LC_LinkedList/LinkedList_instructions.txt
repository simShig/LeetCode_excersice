LL: Constructor
You are tasked with implementing a basic data structure: a singly linked list.

To accomplish this, you will create two classes, Node and LinkedList.

The Node class will represent an individual node within the linked list, while the LinkedList class will manage the overall list structure.

Your implementation should satisfy the following requirements:



Create a Node class with the following features:

A constructor that takes a value as an argument and initializes the value attribute of the node.

A next attribute, initialized to None, which will store a reference to the next node in the list.

Create a LinkedList class with the following features:

A constructor that takes a value as an argument, creates a new Node with that value, and initializes the head and tail attributes of the linked list to point to the new node.

A length attribute, initialized to 1, which represents the current number of nodes in the list.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LL: Print List
Implement a method print_list(self) that prints the linked list's elements, one per line.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LL: Append
Implement the append method for the LinkedList class.

The append method should add a new node with a given value to the end of the linked list, updating the tail attribute and the length attribute accordingly.



Keep in mind the following requirements:



The method should handle the cases where the list is empty and where the list already has one or more nodes.

The method should create a new node with the given value and add it to the end of the list.

The method should update the tail attribute of the LinkedList correctly.

The method should update the length attribute of the LinkedList to reflect the addition of the new node.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LL: Pop
Your task is to implement the pop method for the LinkedList class.

The pop method should remove the last node (tail) from the linked list and return the removed node. If the list is empty, the method should return None.

After the last node is removed, the second-to-last node should become the new tail of the list.

Additionally, if the list becomes empty after the pop operation, both the head and tail attributes should be set to None.



Keep in mind the following requirements:



The method should handle the cases where the list is empty, has only one node, or has multiple nodes.

The method should update the tail attribute of the LinkedList correctly.

The method should update the length attribute of the LinkedList to reflect the removal of the node.

The method should either return the removed node or None if the list is empty.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LL: Prepend
Implement the prepend method for the LinkedList class.

The prepend method should add a new node with a given value to the beginning of the linked list, updating the head attribute and the length attribute accordingly.

Keep in mind the following requirements:



The method should handle the cases where the list is empty and where the list already has one or more nodes.

The method should create a new node with the given value and add it to the beginning of the list.

The method should update the head attribute of the LinkedList correctly.

The method should update the length attribute of the LinkedList to reflect the addition of the new node.

The method should return True if the operation is successful.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LL: Pop First
Implement the pop_first method for the LinkedList class.

The pop_first method should remove the first node (the head) from the linked list, update the head attribute and the length attribute accordingly, and return the removed node.

Keep in mind the following requirements:



The method should handle the cases where the list is empty and where the list has one or more nodes.

The method should save a reference to the current head node before updating the head attribute.

The method should update the head attribute to the second node in the list.

The method should disconnect the removed node from the list by setting its next attribute to None.

The method should update the length attribute of the LinkedList to reflect the removal of the node.

If the list becomes empty after removing the node, the method should set the tail attribute of the LinkedList to None.

The method should return the removed node, or None if the list is empty.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LL: Get
Implement the get method for the LinkedList class.

The get method should take an integer index as a parameter and return a pointer to the node at the specified index in the linked list.

If the index is out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of the list), the method should return None.

Keep in mind the following requirements:



The method should handle the cases where the index is out of bounds.

The method should start at the head of the list and traverse the list using the next attribute of the nodes.

The method should stop traversing the list when it reaches the specified index and return the node at that position.

If the index is out of bounds, the method should return None.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LL: Set
Implement the set_value method for the LinkedList class.

The set_value method should take an integer index and a value as parameters and update the value of the node at the specified index in the linked list.

If the index is out of bounds, the method should return False. If the value is successfully updated, the method should return True.

Keep in mind the following requirements:

The method should utilize the get method to find the node at the specified index.

The method should update the value of the node if the node is found.

The method should return True if the value is successfully updated.

If the node is not found (i.e., the index is out of bounds), the method should return False.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LL: Insert
Implement the insert method for the LinkedList class.

Method signature: def insert(self, index, value):

The insert method should take an integer index and a value as parameters and insert a new node with the given value at the specified index in the linked list.

If the index is out of bounds, the method should return False. If the new node is successfully inserted, the method should return True.

Keep in mind the following requirements:

The method should handle edge cases, such as inserting a new node at the beginning or end of the list.

The method should utilize the prepend, append, and get methods for handling these edge cases.

The method should create a new node with the given value and insert it at the specified index.

The method should update the next attribute of the previous node to point to the new node.

The method should increment the length attribute of the LinkedList class.

The method should return True if the new node is successfully inserted.

If the index is out of bounds, the method should return False.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LL: Remove
Implement the remove method for the LinkedList class.

The remove method should take an integer index as a parameter and remove the node at the specified index in the linked list, returning the removed node.

If the index is out of bounds, the method should return None.

Keep in mind the following requirements:

The method should handle edge cases, such as removing a node at the beginning or end of the list.

The method should utilize the pop_first() and pop() methods for handling these edge cases.

The method should use the get() method to find the node previous to the one to be removed.

The method should update the next attribute of the previous node to point to the node after the removed one.

The method should decrement the length attribute of the LinkedList class.

The method should return the removed node if the removal is successful.

If the index is out of bounds, the method should return None.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LL: Reverse
Implement the reverse method for the LinkedList class.

The reverse method should reverse the order of the nodes in the linked list so that the head becomes the tail and the tail becomes the head.

The method should not create any new nodes or modify the values of the nodes.

The method should only update the next attribute of each node to point to the previous node in the list.

Consider the following requirements while implementing the method:

The method should handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with a single node.

The method should utilize a temporary variable to swap the head and tail attributes of the LinkedList class.

The method should use a loop to iterate through the nodes in the list and update the next attribute of each node.

The method should not modify the length attribute of the LinkedList class.

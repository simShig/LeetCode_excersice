# Repository: LeetCode_excersice

## Description
This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms commonly asked in technical interviews. Each implementation is organized into its respective folder for ease of access and understanding.

### Folder Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

**LC_BinarySearchTree**: Implementations of binary search tree (BST) related interview questions.
**LC_DoubleLinkedList**: Implementations of double linked list related interview questions.
**LC_Graphs**: Implementations of graph related interview questions.
**LC_HashTable**: Implementations of hash table related interview questions.
**LC_Heap**: Implementations of heap related interview questions.
**LC_LinkedList**: Implementations of single linked list related interview questions.
**LC_Queue**: Implementations of queue related interview questions.
**LC_Set**: Implementations of set related interview questions.
**LC_Sorts**: Implementations of various sorting algorithms (insertion, bubble, etc.).
**LC_Stacks**: Implementations of stack related interview questions.
**LC_otherQuestions**: Implementations of other general interview questions.

To use or run the implementations in this repository, you need to have Python installed. 

### Usage
Navigate to the specific folder of the data structure or algorithm you want to explore and run the respective Python scripts.
Each folder contains scripts with implementations and example usage for the respective data structure or algorithm.
Each file has the instructions for the question in its beggining.
